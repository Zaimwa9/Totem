# Totem

Totem is a collaborative festival (https://www.facebook.com/TOTEMCREATE/) where every participants has to lead or engage himself in a project.

Creating Totem's website is, let's say, my way to make it live and a super project to learn node.js and build my first web-application.
I am creating the backend infrastructure by myself and will participate in coding the front.

The purpose of the website/platform is to provide the participants with a place where they'll be able to interact together, to create, upvote or join projects while sharing their ideas.

So far, the architecture follows the MVC, is coded in Node.js using Express as the webserver and MongoDB (quick anecdote, I've been working a lot with SQL in the past and this was a great opportunity to get my hands on NoSQL databases).
