**** Asks Valentin how to create a filter 

0) img upload

1) Project actions:
    a) update & delete (single project page + owner)
    b) post a message (single project page)
    c) upvote a project (all & single project pages)
    d) join a project (all & single project pages)
    e) being curious about a project (on the long-run = receiving the notifications)

2) Filters on projects + search bar (Javascript client-side ?)

3) Your own projects (Javascript client-side ?)

4) Notification system ?
